### Project Title: Simple Python Script for Web Form Data Extraction

#### Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a Python script that retrieves information from a web form based on the input city name and outputs the corresponding postcode. The script should utilize web scraping techniques to extract data from the provided web form.

#### Requirements:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - Accept input for the city name from the user.

2. **Web Scraping:**
   - Utilize web scraping techniques to interact with the web form and extract the postcode corresponding to the input city name.
   - The script should not use Selenium or BeautifulSoup due to deployment constraints.

3. **Minimal Dependencies:**
   - Ensure the script has minimal package dependencies to facilitate deployment.
   - Libraries and packages used should be lightweight and compatible with Python 3.10+.

4. **Output:**
   - Display the extracted postcode as the output of the script.
   - Provide clear and concise output to the user.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected scenarios, such as invalid input or network errors.
   - Ensure informative error messages are provided to the user in case of failures.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Include comprehensive documentation within the script to explain its functionality, usage, and any dependencies.

#### Implementation Details:
- Use lightweight web scraping libraries or HTTP client libraries suitable for minimal dependencies and compatibility with Python 3.10+.
- Consider implementing caching mechanisms to improve efficiency and reduce the frequency of web requests.
- Test the script thoroughly with various input scenarios to ensure robustness and reliability.

#### Deliverables:
- A single Python script file (.py) containing the implementation of the web form data extraction functionality.
- Documentation within the script explaining usage instructions, dependencies, and any other relevant information.

#### Considerations:
- Prioritize simplicity, efficiency, and reliability in the script's design and implementation.
- Follow security best practices when handling user input and interacting with external web resources.

By adhering to these requirements and considerations, the developed Python script will successfully extract information from the provided web form based on the input city name and output the corresponding postcode.
