# Technical Specification for Web Scraping Indie Movies

## Objective:
Design and implement a web scraping solution to extract information about indie movies, including genres, release year, ratings, box office, YouTube trailer link, and streaming services available.

## Requirements:

1. **Scraping Target:**
   - Target websites should focus on platforms that host information about indie movies.
   - Consider popular movie databases, streaming platforms, and review sites.

2. **Data Fields:**
   - Extract the following information for each movie:
     - Title
     - Genres
     - Release Year
     - Ratings
     - Box Office
     - YouTube Trailer Link
     - Streaming Services Available

3. **Frequency of Updates:**
   - Implement a mechanism to update the data on a weekly basis to include new movies.
   - Ensure the scraper identifies and captures changes in existing movie information.

4. **Data Storage:**
   - Store the scraped data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or a database).
   - Organize data by movie, with each movie having its own record.

5. **Robust Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle interruptions, website changes, or connection issues during scraping.
   - Log errors for review and troubleshooting.

6. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Implement rate-limiting to avoid overloading the target website's servers.
   - Ensure the scraper adheres to ethical scraping practices.

7. **User-Agent Rotation:**
   - Rotate User-Agent headers to mimic different web browsers and reduce the likelihood of being blocked by websites.

8. **Proxy Support:**
   - Consider integrating proxy support to prevent IP blocking.

9. **Testing:**
   - Implement unit testing for different components of the scraper to ensure reliability and accuracy.
   - Conduct thorough testing on a variety of movie pages to validate the scraper's functionality.

10. **Documentation:**
    - Provide clear and comprehensive documentation on how to deploy, run, and maintain the web scraper.
    - Include details about configuration options, dependencies, and troubleshooting steps.

11. **Ethical Considerations:**
    - Abide by all relevant laws and terms of service for the target websites.
    - Ensure the scraper operates ethically and does not cause harm or disruption to the target website.

## Deliverables:
- A well-documented and organized Python web scraping script.
- A structured dataset containing information on indie movies.
- Documentation for deployment, configuration, and maintenance.

**Note:** The technical specification provided here outlines the key components and considerations for developing a web scraper for indie movies. Additional details and adjustments may be necessary based on specific website structures and requirements.
